# The Recursive Genesis of All
## A Unified Ontology of Physics, Meaning, and Form

This repository contains the complete manuscript for *The Recursive Genesis of All*, a groundbreaking work that bridges recursive ontology, physics, and formal mathematics through the Self-Producing Horizon (SPH) framework and its integration with the Unified Ontological Representation (UOR) system.

## Overview

This book presents a revolutionary approach to understanding reality through **recursive semantics** — the idea that all structure, from quantum fields to consciousness, emerges from self-referential processes that generate meaning, form, and physical law from pure recursion.

### Key Concepts

- **Self-Producing Horizon (SPH)**: The ontological foundation of recursive reality
- **Recursive Curvature Fields**: The geometric substrate of spacetime and matter
- **Semantic Fixation**: How observation and measurement emerge from recursive loops
- **UOR Integration**: Formal mathematical framework for recursive physics
