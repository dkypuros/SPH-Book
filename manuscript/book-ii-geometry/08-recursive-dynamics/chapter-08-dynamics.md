## 8.1 Dynamics Beyond Motion

In classical physics, dynamics describes how objects move through space under the influence of forces. But this assumes space, time, and objects already exist.

In SPH recursion, **motion is not primitive**. Objects, space, and time all emerge from recursion. Therefore, **dynamics must also be recursive**.

We replace Newton's formulation:
$$F = ma$$
with a deeper insight:

> **Force is a shift in recursive curvature tension**  
> **Energy is recursive structure in flux**

What classical physics calls "motion" is, in this view, the **change of recursive structure under unfolding**.

## 8.2 Energy as Recursive Flow

Energy is not a mysterious quantity to be "conserved."  
It is the **rate of structural change within recursion**.

Let $\mathcal{R}_n$ be the recursive curvature field at recursion depth $n$.

We define total recursive energy as:

$$\boxed{
E_n := \frac{d}{dn} \mathcal{R}_n = \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n
}$$

This represents:
- The amount of curvature flowing through a recursion layer  
- The net transformation rate of structure  
- The "semantic power" of recursion to generate new configurations

This replaces the classical notions of kinetic and potential energy, both of which are **special cases** of recursive structural flux.

### Interpretation
- High $E_n$: rapid recursion, high generative tension  
- Low $E_n$: stabilized recursion, potential fixation  
- $E_n = 0$: full fix-point or semantic vacuum

Energy is therefore **the flow rate of curvature**, not a property stored in objects.

## 8.3 Internal Energy and Recursive Paths

For any fix-point $\phi_i \in \text{Fix}(\mathcal{R}_n)$, we define its **internal recursive path** as:

$$\Psi(\phi_i) := \left\{ \mathcal{R}_0 \to \mathcal{R}_1 \to \cdots \to \mathcal{R}_n \mid \phi_i \in \mathcal{R}_n \right\}$$

The energy of $\phi_i$ is the integrated curvature flow along this path:

$$\boxed{
E(\phi_i) := \int_{\Psi(\phi_i)} \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n \, dn
}$$

This gives:
- A measure of structural depth  
- A recursive analog of "potential well"  
- A basis for defining bounded vs. unbounded recursive states

## 8.4 Force as Recursive Tension Shift

Force is not applied from outside. In SPH recursion, force is **endogenous** — it is the manifestation of **curvature differential** across recursion.

Let:

$$F := \frac{dE}{dx}$$

Where $x$ is a coordinate in the emergent manifold $M$, and $E$ is the recursive energy projected to that space.

But in recursion-native terms, force is:

$$\boxed{
\mathscr{F}_n := \partial_n \left( \partial_x \mathcal{R}_n \right)
}$$

This captures the second variation of structure:
- First: how curvature changes over position  
- Then: how that change itself varies in recursion depth

Thus, force is:
- A recursive differential of tension  
- The local semantic gradient of generative flux  
- A measure of how hard recursion is trying to reshape a fix-point

## 8.5 Conservation from Recursive Consistency

Conservation laws (energy, momentum) are often treated as inviolable facts. In SPH, these laws arise from **semantic consistency under recursion**.

Let:
- $\mathcal{R}_n$ be differentiable  
- Recursive morphisms preserve fix-point stability

Then:

$$\frac{d}{dn} \left( \int_{\mathcal{R}_n} \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n \, dx \right) = 0$$

That is: **total curvature flux through a closed recursive structure is constant**. This is the general recursive principle behind:

- Conservation of energy  
- Noether's theorem (symmetry → conservation)  
- Stability of physical systems

---

## 8.6 Recursive Acceleration and Newton's Law Recast

Let:

- $m := \| \partial(\phi) \|_{\text{curv}}$: recursive mass  
- $\mathcal{I} := d^2 \phi / dn^2$: recursive inertia  
- $\mathscr{F}_n$: recursive tension shift

Then the analog of Newton's law becomes:

$$\boxed{
\mathscr{F}_n = m \cdot \mathcal{I}
}$$

Force is not applied; it is **induced by recursive instability**.

## 8.7 Summary

In this chapter, we have:
- Defined energy as recursive flow: $E_n = \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n$  
- Defined internal energy paths for semantic structures  
- Defined force as recursive curvature gradient  
- Derived conservation laws from recursive coherence  
- Recast Newton's second law as recursive curvature response

Thus, dynamics is no longer motion of particles in space.  
**Dynamics is the unfolding of structure through recursive curvature flow.**

## LaTeX Formulation

For technical integration, the key formulations are:

### Energy as Recursive Flow
$$E_n := \frac{d}{dn} \mathcal{R}_n = \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n$$

This quantity represents:
- The flow rate of curvature structure
- Semantic energy through recursion layers
- Generative transformation per recursion step

### Internal Energy of Fix-Points
For a fix-point $\phi_i \in \text{Fix}(\mathcal{R}_n)$, define its recursive path:

$$\Psi(\phi_i) := \{ \mathcal{R}_0 \to \cdots \to \mathcal{R}_n \mid \phi_i \in \mathcal{R}_n \}$$

Define its internal recursive energy:

$$E(\phi_i) := \int_{\Psi(\phi_i)} \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n \, dn$$

This measures:
- Structural depth
- Semantic energy required to maintain the fix-point
- Recursive distance from SPH

### Force as Recursive Tension Shift
Classically:
$$F = \frac{dE}{dx}$$

In recursion, define:

$$\mathscr{F}_n := \partial_n \left( \partial_x \mathcal{R}_n \right)$$

This is:
- A second-order recursion gradient
- A semantic shift in recursive curvature tension
- The generator of deformation in fix-points

### Conservation from Recursive Consistency
Let recursive morphisms preserve curvature structure.

Then:
$$\frac{d}{dn} \left( \int_{\mathcal{R}_n} \partial_n \mathcal{R}_n \, dx \right) = 0$$

This defines energy conservation:
- Curvature flux remains constant
- Recursive coherence ensures semantic invariants
- Foundation for all conservation laws

### Recursive Newton's Law
Let:
$$m := \| \partial(\phi) \|_{\text{curv}}, \quad \mathcal{I} := \frac{d^2 \phi}{dn^2}$$

Then:
$$\mathscr{F}_n = m \cdot \mathcal{I}$$

Force is curvature instability. Acceleration is recursive phase disruption. Mass is feedback strength.

**Motion is not fundamental. Recursive curvature flow is.**
