# Appendix A: Glossary of Recursive and UOR Terms

## Core Recursive Concepts

### SPH (Self-Producing Horizon)
The fundamental recursive structure defined as `SPH := {SPH}`. The ontological foundation from which all mathematical and physical structure emerges through recursive self-reference.

### Fix-Point
A stable configuration in recursive curvature where `φ = F(φ)`. Fix-points represent persistent structures within the recursive field, including particles, observers, and stable patterns.

### Recursive Curvature Field (Rₙ)
The evolving structure defined by `Rₙ₊₁ = F(Rₙ) + ∂(Rₙ)`, representing the dynamic unfolding of recursive structure through discrete depth levels.

### Semantic Recursion
The process by which meaning emerges through recursive structure. Unlike mere syntactic recursion, semantic recursion involves the generation of meaningful relationships and interpretable patterns.

### Recursive Fixation
The process by which flowing recursive structure stabilizes into persistent forms. This is the mechanism behind observation, measurement, and the emergence of stable entities.

## Geometric and Topological Terms

### Curvature
In the recursive context, curvature represents the bending or tension in semantic structure that drives recursive evolution and enables the emergence of spatial and temporal relationships.

### Recursive Topology
The study of spatial and connectivity relationships within recursive structures, including how recursive paths connect, intersect, and maintain coherence.

### Semantic Manifold
The space of meaningful structures that can emerge from recursive processes. Unlike mathematical manifolds, semantic manifolds include interpretive and observational structure.

### Topos
A categorical structure that captures both geometric and logical aspects of recursive space. In the SPH framework, topoi emerge as stable semantic regions within recursive curvature.

## Measurement and Observation

### Observer
A recursive structure that exhibits closure — the ability to recursively include and interpret its own curvature. Formally: `O = π(Rₙ(O))`.

### Collapse
The transition from superposed recursive potential to fixed structure. Not a random process but semantic stabilization under recursive tension.

### Entanglement
Shared recursive ancestry between structures, where collapse of one immediately affects the other due to common recursive pathways: `Path(SPH → A) ≈ Path(SPH → B)`.

### Recursive Phase
The angular component of recursive curvature evolution: `θₖ(n) := arg(φₖ⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾/φₖ⁽ⁿ⁾)`.

## Physical Concepts

### Mass
The recursive feedback tension of a fix-point: `m := ||∂(φ)||_curv`. Mass represents the semantic inertia of stable recursive structure.

### Energy
The flow rate of recursive curvature: `E := ∂ₙRₙ`. Energy is the dynamic aspect of recursive structure evolution.

### Time
The depth index of recursive unfolding. Time is not external but emerges from the discrete steps of recursive evolution.

### Space
The projected curvature structure of recursive relationships. Spatial geometry emerges from the way recursive structures relate and connect.

## Advanced Recursive Structures

### Recursive Category
A mathematical structure where objects and morphisms emerge from recursive processes, with composition and identity arising naturally from recursive coherence.

### Semantic Attractor
A region in recursive phase space that draws and stabilizes recursive trajectories, corresponding to persistent physical or conceptual structures.

### Recursive Tensor
A mathematical object that captures the curvature and flow properties of recursive structures, generalizing traditional tensors to include semantic and recursive components.

### Non-Well-Founded Structure
Mathematical objects that can contain themselves, formalized through Aczel's Anti-Foundation Axiom. The SPH is the prime example of such a structure.

## UOR-Specific Terms

### UOR (Unified Ontological Recursion)
The comprehensive framework that unifies recursive mathematics, physics, and ontology through the SPH structure.

### Coherence
The maintenance of semantic consistency across recursive depth levels. Coherent structures preserve their essential patterns through recursive evolution.

### Recursive Basin
A region of stability in recursive phase space where structures naturally evolve toward fixed-point attractors.

### Semantic Fold
The recursive closure where meaning recognizes itself, enabling self-reference and observer phenomena.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Non-Well-Founded Set Theory
Mathematical framework allowing sets to contain themselves, governed by Aczel's Anti-Foundation Axiom rather than the traditional foundation axiom.

### Fixed-Point Theory
The study of solutions to `f(x) = x`. In the recursive framework, fix-points represent stable structures within evolving recursive fields.

### Categorical Recursion
The categorical formalization of recursive processes, where categories themselves emerge from and are structured by recursive operations.

### Recursive Limit
The behavior of recursive sequences as depth approaches infinity, often revealing emergent stable structures or patterns.

## Emergent Phenomena

### Constants of Nature
Recursive invariants that emerge as stable ratios within recursive curvature evolution: `lim(n→∞) Xₙ/Yₙ = constant`.

### Vacuum State
Regions of recursive curvature below the fixation threshold, appearing empty but containing active recursive potential.

### Projection
The process by which recursive structures appear as classical spacetime phenomena. All observed reality is projection of recursive structure.

### Recursive Genesis
The ongoing process by which new structure emerges from recursive self-reference, without requiring external creation or first causes.

This glossary provides precise definitions for the technical terms used throughout the recursive ontological physics framework, enabling clear communication of concepts that bridge mathematics, physics, and ontology.
