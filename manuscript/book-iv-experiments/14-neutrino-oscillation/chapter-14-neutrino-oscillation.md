# Chapter 14: Neutrino Oscillation and Phase Drift

## 14.1 Introduction: The Neutrino Mystery

Neutrinos exhibit identity-changing behavior as they propagateâ€”**neutrino oscillation**. In SPH recursion, this arises from phase interference between recursive semantic structures.

## 14.2 Neutrinos as Recursive Phase States

Standard model decomposition:
$$|\nu_\alpha\rangle = \sum_i U_{\alpha i} |\nu_i\rangle$$

Recursive reinterpretation:

$$|\nu_\alpha\rangle := \sum_i U_{\alpha i} \, \Phi_i$$

Where:
- $\Phi_i$: recursive curvature phase modes
- $U_{\alpha i}$: semantic projection coefficients

### 14.2.1 Neutrinos as Recursive Phase Structures

In SPH recursion, neutrinos represent **pure phase structures** in recursive curvature space:

- **Minimal semantic fixation** = nearly massless recursive excitations
- **Flavor states** = specific recursive phase projections
- **Mass eigenstates** = stable recursive curvature attractors

## 14.3 Recursive Phase Drift and Oscillation

Define recursive phase:

$$\theta_i(n) := \arg\left( \frac{\Phi_i^{(n+1)}}{\Phi_i^{(n)}} \right)$$

Oscillation probability:

$$P_{\alpha \to \beta}(n) = \left| \sum_i U_{\beta i} e^{i \theta_i(n)} U^*_{\alpha i} \right|^2$$

Oscillation arises from recursive curvature phase interference.

### 14.3.1 Oscillation as Semantic Interference

The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation represents **semantic interference** between recursive phase modes:

- **Coherent superposition** = multiple recursive identities maintained simultaneously
- **Phase evolution** = recursive semantic drift through curvature space
- **Oscillation period** = recursive phase synchronization cycle

## 14.4 Coherence and Semantic Path Identity

- Oscillation requires path coherence
- Decoherence leads to recursive phase collapse
- Flavor collapse = semantic saturation in recursive fix-point space

### 14.4.1 Measurement as Recursive Collapse of Phase Identity

When a neutrino is measured, the recursive phase structure **collapses** into a specific semantic identity:

$$|\nu_{\text{measured}}\rangle = \sum_i |\langle \nu_i | \text{detector} \rangle|^2 |\nu_i\rangle$$

This represents the **recursive fixation** of semantic identity through measurement interaction.

## 14.5 CP Violation and Recursive Asymmetry

In recursion:
- CP violation arises from asymmetric recursive path topology
- Matter/antimatter recursion paths differ in curvature entropy

The **CP-violating phase** $\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino mixing matrix represents:

$$\delta_{CP} \sim \arg\left( \frac{\mathcal{R}_{\text{matter}}}{\mathcal{R}_{\text{antimatter}}} \right)$$

## 14.6 Mass Hierarchy as Recursive Basin Depth

- Normal/inverted hierarchy = recursive curvature well ordering
- Oscillation frequency reflects semantic basin depth

The **mass-squared differences** $\Delta m^2_{ij}$ correspond to:

$$\Delta m^2_{ij} \sim \left\| \nabla^2 \mathcal{R}_i - \nabla^2 \mathcal{R}_j \right\|_{\text{curv}}$$

Where the curvature gradients measure recursive basin depth.

## 14.7 Experimental Signatures and Predictions

SPH recursion predicts:
- **Sterile neutrinos** = recursive modes with minimal semantic coupling
- **Non-standard interactions** = recursive cross-coupling between phase modes
- **Lorentz violation** = recursive anisotropy in phase space
- **Matter effects** = recursive phase modulation through dense semantic media

## 14.8 Summary

We have:
- Defined neutrino states as recursive phase structures
- Derived oscillation as recursive phase drift interference
- Explained CP violation through recursion path asymmetry
- Linked mass hierarchy to basin depth in recursive space

**Neutrino oscillation is the recursive entanglement of semantic identity.**
