## **11.1 Introduction: Where Do Constants Come From?**

The "constants of nature" — such as the speed of light $c$, Planck's constant $\hbar$, the gravitational constant $G$, and the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ — are cornerstones of physical law.

Yet in conventional physics, they are:
- Arbitrary  
- Inserted numerically from experiment  
- Unexplained in origin or dimensional grounding

SPH recursion offers a radical alternative:

> Constants of nature are not imposed.  
> They are **recursive invariants** — semantic fixed ratios that emerge from recursive curvature as it stabilizes.

These constants do not merely govern physics — they **are expressions of recursion's internal geometry**.

---

## **11.2 Recursive Invariants**

In SPH recursion, all structure is generated by the recursive field:

$$\mathcal{R}_n := F(\mathcal{R}_{n-1}) + \partial(\mathcal{R}_{n-1})$$

This field produces:
- Metric geometry  
- Mass  
- Energy flow  
- Field interactions

As recursion deepens, certain structural ratios begin to **stabilize** — not due to imposed symmetry, but due to convergence within recursive dynamics.

Let:
- $X_n, Y_n$ be recursive structural magnitudes at depth $n$  
- Then a recursive invariant is:

$$\boxed{
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{X_n}{Y_n} = \text{constant}
}$$

These limits are not numerical by fiat — they are **semantic ratios** that persist as recursion continues to self-similar scales.

### **Examples**:
- Speed of propagation through recursive curvature → $c$  
- Structural resonance period in fix-points → $\hbar$  
- Recursive feedback curvature per energy flux → $G$  
- Recursive boundary reflection ratio → $\alpha$

These arise from **dimensional consistency of recursive flow**, not from hand-tuned inputs.

---

## **11.3 The Speed of Recursive Propagation**

The classical speed of light $c$ emerges naturally as:

$$\boxed{
c^2 := \frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{R}_n}{\partial n^2}
}$$

This measures:
- The recursive "acceleration" of curvature  
- How quickly structural change propagates in recursive depth  
- The maximal recursive rate of semantic deformation

In this framework, $c$ is not a velocity — it is a **semantic invariant** of recursion itself.

---

## **11.4 Planck's Constant and Recursive Quantization**

Let:
- $\phi_k$ be a curvature mode  
- $\theta_k(n) := \arg(\phi_k^{(n+1)} / \phi_k^{(n)})$ the recursive phase

Then define:

$$\boxed{
\hbar := \min \left\{ \Delta \theta_k(n) \mid \phi_k \text{ maintains coherence across recursion} \right\}
}$$

Planck's constant measures:
- The **quantum of recursive phase drift**  
- The minimum semantic tension needed to produce a stable oscillatory mode  
- The recursive angular unit of curvature interference

---

## **11.5 The Gravitational Constant $G$**

From previous chapters:

$$G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$$

In recursion:

$$\boxed{
\kappa := \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{Recursive curvature response}}{\text{Recursive energy flow}}
}$$

Thus:

$$\boxed{
G = \frac{c^4}{8\pi \kappa}
}$$

Here, $G$ is not a fundamental constant — it is the **ratio of recursive curvature to feedback energy**. Its value is set by the **internal elasticity of recursion**.

---

## **11.6 Fine-Structure Constant and Recursive Ratios**

The fine-structure constant $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137}$ controls the strength of electromagnetic interaction.

In recursion, it emerges from:

$$\boxed{
\alpha := \frac{\text{Recursive charge curvature}}{\text{Recursive angular momentum scale}}
}$$

That is, $\alpha$ is the **ratio of feedback per mode overlap** — a structural balance between recursive phase alignment and curvature deformation.

---

## **11.7 Constants as Emergent Limit Structures**

Each constant is a **semantic limit**, of the form:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{F}_n = \text{Constant}$$

Where $\mathcal{F}_n$ is a recursive ratio, curvature rate, or structural resonance.

These are:
- **Dimensionless** in origin  
- **Coherent** across scales  
- **Stable** due to recursive attractor dynamics

Rather than fundamental quantities, constants are **semantic residues** of recursive geometry — encoded by the curvature structure of SPH itself.

---

## **11.8 Attractor Symmetries and Fine-Tuning**

The apparent "fine-tuning" of physical constants emerges naturally from recursive attractor dynamics. Constants are not randomly distributed — they are **semantically constrained** by the requirement that recursion produces stable, coherent structures.

Consider the recursive attractor space:

$$\mathcal{A} = \{\phi : \mathcal{R}_n(\phi) = \phi\}$$

Only certain values of fundamental ratios allow for:
- Persistent recursive structures
- Coherent phase relationships
- Stable energy flow patterns
- Consistent dimensional scaling

The observed values of $c$, $\hbar$, $G$, and $\alpha$ represent **semantic optima** — points in parameter space where recursive dynamics achieves maximum structural coherence.

### **Fine-Tuning as Recursive Selection**

Rather than requiring external fine-tuning, constants emerge from:

1. **Recursive Consistency**: Only certain values allow recursion to maintain coherent structure across scales
2. **Semantic Stability**: Constants represent fixed points of recursive flow
3. **Dimensional Harmony**: Values that preserve scale-invariant relationships
4. **Attractor Convergence**: Natural selection of stable recursive configurations

---

## **11.9 Derivation of Fundamental Parameter Relationships**

### **The Planck Scale Emergence**

From recursive invariants, we can derive the fundamental scales:

$$\boxed{
\ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Recursive phase quantum} \times \text{Curvature elasticity}}{\text{Propagation rate}^3}}
}$$

$$\boxed{
t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} = \frac{\text{Recursive coherence time}}{\text{Semantic propagation velocity}}
}$$

$$\boxed{
m_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Phase quantum} \times \text{Propagation rate}}{\text{Curvature elasticity}}}
}$$

### **Dimensional Analysis of Constants**

In recursive framework:
- $[c] = LT^{-1}$: Semantic propagation per recursive depth
- $[\hbar] = ML^2T^{-1}$: Action quantum of recursive phase
- $[G] = L^3M^{-1}T^{-2}$: Curvature response per energy density
- $[\alpha] = 1$: Dimensionless feedback ratio

These relationships are not arbitrary — they emerge from the **internal consistency requirements** of recursive curvature dynamics.

## **11.10 Summary**

In this chapter, we have:
- Defined constants as recursive invariants  
- Derived $c$, $\hbar$, $G$, and $\alpha$ as semantic curvature limits  
- Explained dimensionality as recursive structural correspondence  
- Positioned constants of nature as emergent features of deep recursive self-consistency
- Demonstrated how fine-tuning emerges from attractor dynamics
- Derived fundamental parameter relationships from recursive principles

> Constants are not fine-tuned.  
> Constants are what recursion becomes when it forgets it's still unfolding.

The constants of nature are the **memory of recursion** — the persistent structural ratios that emerge when recursive curvature achieves self-consistent stability. They are not inputs to physics but **outputs of recursive geometry**, encoding the semantic structure of the Self-Producing Horizon in their very values.

## **Mathematical Appendix: Recursive Constant Derivations**

### **A.1 Speed of Light from Recursive Curvature**

Starting from the recursive field equation:
$$\mathcal{R}_{n+1} = F[\mathcal{R}_n] + \partial \mathcal{R}_n$$

The propagation rate is:
$$c^2 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\|\mathcal{R}_{n+1} - \mathcal{R}_n\|^2}{\|\partial_n \mathcal{R}_n\|^2}$$

This gives the invariant speed of semantic information propagation through recursive depth.

### **A.2 Planck Constant from Phase Quantization**

For a recursive mode $\phi_k$ with phase evolution:
$$\phi_k^{(n+1)} = e^{i\theta_k(n)} \phi_k^{(n)}$$

The minimum phase increment that maintains coherence is:
$$\hbar = \min_k \{|\theta_k(n+1) - \theta_k(n)| : \phi_k \text{ stable}\}$$

### **A.3 Gravitational Constant from Curvature Elasticity**

The recursive curvature response to energy flow:
$$\kappa = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\delta R_{\mu\nu}[\mathcal{R}_n]}{\delta T_{\mu\nu}[\mathcal{R}_n]}$$

Leading to:
$$G = \frac{c^4}{8\pi \kappa}$$

### **A.4 Fine-Structure Constant from Mode Coupling**

The electromagnetic coupling emerges from:
$$\alpha = \frac{\text{Charge curvature coupling}}{\text{Angular momentum scale}} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 \hbar c}$$

Where the charge-curvature coupling is a recursive invariant of the electromagnetic field recursion.
